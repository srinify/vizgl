## Hello 

I'm Srini Kadamati, a data scientist, developer advocate, and educator based in Boston. I've spent my whole career at startups.

- I'm currently a Senior Developer Advocate at Preset.io, focused on the [Apache Superset project](https://superset.apache.org/).
- Previously, I was the first full-time employee at [Dataquest.io](https://dataquest.io/), an online learning platform focused on data skills. I started as a data science content author and then eventually managed the Content, Engineering, and Product efforts there.
- Before Dataquest, I worked at [Radius Intelligence](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/radius-intelligence-inc) as a data scientist embedded on the Business Development team.
- My first full-time job was as a Software Engineer at [Bioniq Health](https://angel.co/company/bioniq-health)
